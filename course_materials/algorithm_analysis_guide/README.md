# Algorithm Analysis Learning Guide

Welcome to this learning guide for Algorithm Analysis! This guide is designed to provide a structured approach to understanding fundamental concepts in algorithm design, analysis, and computational complexity. The material is tailored to cover common university-level topics and questions, with concise explanations and Python code examples where appropriate.

## Course Structure

This guide is divided into eight units, mirroring a typical weekly schedule for an introductory algorithms course:

-   **[Unit 1: Review of Data Structures and Algorithms](./Unit1_Data_Structures_Algorithms_Review.md)**
    -   Recap of common data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables).
    -   Review of time/space complexity and Big O notation.

-   **[Unit 2: Divide and Conquer Algorithms](./Unit2_Divide_and_Conquer.md)**
    -   The Divide and Conquer strategy.
    -   Examples: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (with Python code).
    -   Analysis using recurrence relations (Master Theorem introduction).

-   **[Unit 3: Graphs (Part 1) - Representations and Traversals](./Unit3_Graphs_Part1.md)**
    -   Graph terminology and representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List).
    -   Traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS) (with Python code).

-   **[Unit 4: Graphs (Part 2) - Shortest Paths and Minimum Spanning Trees](./Unit4_Graphs_Part2.md)**
    -   Shortest Path Algorithms: Dijkstra's (with Python code), Bellman-Ford.
    -   Minimum Spanning Trees: Prim's, Kruskal's.

-   **[Unit 5: Dynamic Programming](./Unit5_Dynamic_Programming.md)**
    -   Core concepts: Optimal Substructure, Overlapping Subproblems.
    -   Memoization vs. Tabulation.
    -   Examples: Fibonacci, 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (with Python code).

-   **[Unit 6: Linear Programming and Reductions](./Unit6_Linear_Programming_Reductions.md)**
    -   Introduction to Linear Programming (LP) formulation.
    -   Concept of polynomial-time reductions in algorithm design.

-   **[Unit 7: Limits to Computation (Part 1) - P, NP, and NP-Completeness](./Unit7_Limits_to_Computation_Part1.md)**
    -   Complexity classes P and NP.
    -   The P vs. NP problem.
    -   NP-hard and NP-complete problems; role of reductions.
    -   Classic NP-complete examples (SAT, TSP, Vertex Cover).

-   **[Unit 8: Limits to Computation (Part 2) - Undecidability and Further Frontiers](./Unit8_Limits_to_Computation_Part2.md)**
    -   Undecidability: The Halting Problem and its significance.
    -   Rice's Theorem.
    -   Brief overview of other complexity classes (co-NP, PSPACE).
    -   Implications for software engineering.

## Learning Objectives and Outcomes (Course-Level)

By working through these units, students will be able to:

-   Articulate the characteristics and design of fundamental patterns of algorithms.
-   Implement algorithms (examples provided in Python).
-   Understand the characteristics of different algorithm designs including: Brute Force (implicitly covered), Backtracking (related to DFS, touched upon in examples like N-Queens if added), Branch and Bound (related to optimization, briefly if specific examples like TSP optimization were detailed), Greedy (Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's), Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and concepts related to Linear Programming.
-   Asymptotically analyze algorithms (Big O notation).
-   Describe and discuss theoretical computer science concepts such as hard problems (NP-completeness) and undecidability (the Halting Problem).

## How to Use This Guide

1.  Navigate to the unit you are interested in using the links above.
2.  Read through the conceptual explanations.
3.  Study the provided examples and Python code.
4.  Attempt to answer the example questions to test your understanding.
5.  For coding examples, try to implement them yourself and experiment with different inputs.

Happy learning!
