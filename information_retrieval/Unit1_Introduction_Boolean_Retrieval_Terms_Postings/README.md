# Unit 1: Introduction to IR, Boolean Retrieval, and Terms and Postings

Welcome to Unit 1! This week, we will begin our journey into the fascinating world of Information Retrieval (IR). We'll cover the foundational concepts that underpin how search systems work.

## Topics Covered:

*   **Introduction to Information Retrieval (IR):**
    *   What is IR?
    *   Brief history and evolution of IR.
    *   Key challenges and components of an IR system.
    *   Overview of different retrieval models.
*   **Boolean Retrieval:**
    *   The concept of unstructured data and how Boolean retrieval addresses it.
    *   An overview of the Boolean retrieval model.
    *   Processing Boolean queries: AND, OR, NOT operators.
    *   The idea of an inverted index as a core data structure.
*   **Terms and Postings:**
    *   Defining terms, documents, and collections.
    *   Understanding postings lists and their role in an inverted index.
    *   The process of creating a simple inverted index.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

*   Define Information Retrieval and explain its basic concepts.
*   Understand the Boolean retrieval model and how Boolean queries are processed.
*   Explain what terms and postings lists are and how they form the basis of an inverted index.
